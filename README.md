## Description
The emailAccountLinker returns all accounts linked to a given Gmail. 
It accomplishes this task by using Googleâ€™s scripting service for Gmail 
to scan for accounts associated with the given Gmail account. Afterwards 
the accounts are filtered by heuristics to better display a list of accounts.
On acceptance of basic policies and given permission, the emailAccountLinker 
will process the Gmail account and report back to the user.
