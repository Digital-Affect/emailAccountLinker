# digitalFootprint

## Description
The emailAccountLinker returns all accounts linked to a given Gmail. 
It accomplishes this task by using Google’s scripting service for Gmail 
to scan for accounts associated with the given Gmail account. Afterwards 
the accounts are filtered by heuristics to better display a list of accounts. 
Basically, users will receive an email form digitalFootprint. On acceptance of 
basic policies and given permission, the emailAccountLinker will process the 
Gmail account and report both to the user and digitalFootprint. *\*No other information is 
gleaned, saved, and otherwise used besides names of accounts. All information, 
including accounts, will be removed from digitalFootprint after the digital footprint’s creation.\**
